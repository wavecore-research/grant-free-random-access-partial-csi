# Grant-Free Random Access in Massive MIMO for IoT Nodes with partial CSI
Simulation code

## How to run

1. Install Nvidia drivers for the GPU (see cupy for more information)
2. install conda (miniconda/anaconda)
3. open anaconda prompt and navigate to the project folder
4. create conda environment: `conda env create --file environment.yaml`
5. activate the conda environment: `conda activate grant-free-random-access-partial-csi`
6. run the simulation: `python ./main_v3.py`
